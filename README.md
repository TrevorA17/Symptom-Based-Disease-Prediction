# Symptom-Based-Disease-Prediction
This project implements a Symptom-Based Disease Prediction API built with R and Plumber. The prediction engine uses a trained Naive Bayes model that has been saved in models/saved_nb_model.rds along with a model_metadata.rds file containing essential information about the dataset structure, column types, and factor levels. This metadata ensures that any incoming request is automatically validated and transformed to match the exact format expected by the model, preventing runtime errors and improving prediction reliability. The API accepts patient symptom data via HTTP requests, processes it into the correct structure, and returns a predicted disease class. This architecture makes the system robust, reproducible, and easy to integrate with other applications.
