# Setup Chunk

**Note:** the following KnitR options have been set as the global defaults: <BR> `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE, collapse = FALSE, tidy = TRUE)`.

More KnitR options are documented here <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-options.html> and here <https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(formatR)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE,
